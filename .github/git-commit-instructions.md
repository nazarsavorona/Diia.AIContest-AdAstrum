# git-commit-instructions.md

Use **semantic commit messages** to ensure clarity, consistency, and maintainability.

## Rules
1. **Commit types**:
   - `feat:` – new feature
   - `fix:` – bug fix
   - `refactor:` – code refactoring without changing behavior
   - `chore:` – maintenance tasks, config updates, dependency bumps
   - `docs:` – documentation changes
   - `test:` – adding or updating tests
   - `perf:` – performance improvements
   - `ci:` – continuous integration / pipeline updates
   - `style:` – formatting, linting, code style (no logic changes)
    
3. **Summary rules**:
- Max 70–80 characters
- No trailing periods
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "add", "update", "remove")
4. **Body (optional)**:
- Explain *what* and *why*, not *how*
- Use when context is not obvious
